### Added

- Add memory read error.
- Add support for building NPD on MacOS.

- Add metric for `per-cpu`, `per-stage` timing.

### Fixed

- Windows build now supported.

### Fixed

- Fixed custom plugin command timeout when the command spawns a long running
  child process.

## [0.8.5] - 2020-11-18

### Added

- Added problem detection for buffer I/O error.
- Added CPU load average metrics support.
- Added kubelet apiserver connection check in health checker.

### Changed

- Will now catch hung task with pattern like `tasks airflow scheduler: *`.
- Better handling to avoid duplicating disk bytes metrics used on fstype and
  mount types.

### Fixed

- Fixed the deployment yaml to prevent NPD from scheduling onto windows nodes.
- Fixed memory unit for `/proc/meminfo` metrics.
- Fixed OOMKilling detection for new linux kernel v5.1+.

## [0.8.4] - 2020-09-01

### Added

- Added `FSType` and `MountOption` as labels to the metric `disk_usage_bytes`.
- Added `DockerContainerStartupFailure` event in `docker-monitor.json` to
  detect docker issue
  [docker/for-linux#647](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/647).

### Fixed

- Reduced log spam generated by the custom plugin monitor.

## [0.8.3] - 2020-06-30

### Added

- `health-checker` binary now included in the docker image.

### Changed

- `--enable-repair=true` is now the default for docker and kubelet health
  checker.
- Custom plugin will now only generate status update log when the status has
  changed.
- Limit the size of custom plugin output to 4kb, extra output will be drained
  and discarded.

### Fixed

- Fix a race condition that services may be killed periodically when
  `--enable-repair=true`, and systemd service restart time equals the health
  check period.

## [0.8.2] - 2020-05-28

### Added

- Added an `--event-namespace` flag to make event namespace configurable.
- Added `rhel` support in OS version.
- Added `health-checker` as a custom plugin. The `health-checker` can be used
  to monitor healthiness of kubelet, docker and CRI container runtimes (e.g.
  `containerd`, `cri-o`) and restart them if they are not healthy if
  `enable-repair` is turned on.

### Fixed

- [#420](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector/issues/420) Added
  missing `lsblk` to the container image.

## [0.8.1] - 2020-02-25

### Added

- Added `host_uptime` metrics for CentOS.
- Now collecting a lot more useful CPU/disk/memory metrics.

  conntrack table is 90% full.

### Fixed

- [#366](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector/issues/366) Fixed
  building with `ENABLE_JOURNALD=0`.
- Fixed the first 0 value metrics reported for `disk_avg_queue_len`.
- Fix a few metric units for disk metrics and the calculation for
  `disk_avg_queue_len`.

## [0.8.0] - 2019-10-30

### Added

- Added Stackdriver exporter.
- Added a `k8s-exporter-heartbeat-period` flag to make the heart beat period
  of K8s exporter configurable.

### Changed

- Changed the default heart beat period of K8s exporter from `1m` to `5m`.

### Fixed

- Addressed an issue with a panic caused by closing an already closed channel.
- Fixed several potential busy loops.

## [0.7.1] - 2019-08-27

### Added

- Added validation that permanent problems habe a preset default condition.

### Changed

- Empty LogPath will now use journald's default path.
- Systemd monitor now looks back 5 minutes.
- Bumped base image to `registry.k8s.io/debian-base-amd64:1.0.0`.
- Updated the detection method for docker overlay2 issues.
- Moved NPD into the kube-system namespace.

### Fixed

- [#202](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector/issues/202) Fixed
  an issue that condition can't switch back to false for custom plugins.

## [0.7.0] - 2019-07-25

### Added

- Added a system stats monitor is added into NPD as a new problem daemon. It
  collects useful node problem related system stats with OpenCensus such as
  `disk/io_time`, `disk/weighted_io` and `disk/avg_queue_len`.
- Besides node condition and events, problems detected by existing problem
  daemons are also collected into OpenCensus as metrics:
  `problem_counter{reason="PROBLEM_REASON"} xxx` for events and
  `problem_gauge{reason="PROBLEM_REASON",type="PROBLEM_TYPE"} 1 or 0` for
  conditions.
- A Prometheus exporter is added to export all OpenCensus metrics collected by
  NPD through Prometheus.
- A plugin system for problem daemons is added. Problem daemons can be disabled
  at compile time with build tags, such as `disable_system_stats_monitor`,
  `disable_system_log_monitor` and `disable_custom_plugin_monitor`.
- A problem exporter interface is added. The original kubernetes problem
  reporting logic was moved into `k8sexporter`. Prometheus support is
  implemented as `prometheusexporter`.
