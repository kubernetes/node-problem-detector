# "builder-base" can be overriden using dockerb buildx's --build-context flag,
# by users who want to use a different images for the builder. E.g. if you need to use an older OS
# to avoid dependencies on very recent glibc versions.
# E.g. of the param: --build-context builder-base=docker-image://golang:<something>@sha256:<something>
# Must override builder-base, not builder, since the latter is referred to later in the file and so must not be
# directly replaced. See here, and note that "stage" parameter mentioned there has been renamed to
# "build-context": https://github.com/docker/buildx/pull/904#issuecomment-1005871838
